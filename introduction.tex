During this audit, we used the following classification of our findings, into three kinds of issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Critical Issues:} such issues can lead to taking ownership of resources (tokens, contracts), or total
  disabling of the service;
\item {\bf Major Issues:} such issues can lead to a decrease in the quality of the service,
  or temporary loss of availability;
\item {\bf Minor Issues:} Such issues do not impact the service
  itself. For example, code improvements to improve readability, to
  improve sharing, etc.
\end{itemize}

We found XX critical issues, YY major issues and ZZ minor issues
during this audit of the contracts.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf XX Critical Issues:}
\item {\bf YY Major Issues:}
\item {\bf ZZ Minor Issues:}
\end{itemize}

For easier access to issues, we provided a table of issues at the
beginning of the document.
