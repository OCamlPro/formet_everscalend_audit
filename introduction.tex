% During the security audit, we used the following classification of our findings, into three kinds of issues:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\bf Critical Issues:} such issues can lead to taking ownership of resources (tokens, contracts), or total
%   disabling of the service;
% \item {\bf Major Issues:} such issues can lead to a decrease in the quality of the service,
%   or temporary loss of availability;
% \item {\bf Minor Issues:} Such issues do not impact the service
%   itself. For example, code improvements to improve readability, to
%   improve sharing, etc.
% \end{itemize}

% We found XX critical issues, YY major issues and ZZ minor issues
% during this audit of the contracts.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\bf XX Critical Issues:}
% \item {\bf YY Major Issues:}
% \item {\bf ZZ Minor Issues:}
% \end{itemize}

% For easier access to issues, we provided a table of issues at the
% beginning of the document.
